# About

Dominoes is an approach for analyzing software repositories with thousands of artifacts by considering multiple perspectives of the software development data. We model the data extracted from software repositories and its relationships as matrices, making possible to efficiently process them with a GPUs (Graphics Processing Unit) based architectures.

Dominoes can support automated exploration of different relationships among project artifacts, where users have the flexibility to interactively combine and compose them.

# Usage

In order to ease Dominoes usage, it can be loaded over internet by using the Java Web Start technology. It will automatically detect for a GPU enable device and switch to a CPU processing in case of fail. 

In order to start Dominoes, please follow the steps:

1. Install [Armadillo] (http://arma.sourceforge.net) (linear algebra for CPU processing). It can be installed through a package manger in Linux or Unix using the following commands:

* sudo yum install armadillo (Fedora)
* sudo apt-get install armadillo (Ubuntu)
* [brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/install) install armadillo (OSX)

2. Install CUDA Video Driver for supported Nvidia Graphics Card ([Linux](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) and [OSX](http://www.nvidia.com/object/mac-driver-archive.html)). 

3. Due to the security issues imposed by Java Web Start technology, it is necessary to add a new entry to the exception site list. In order to perform this, open the Java Panel and select **Security** tab. In there, select **"Edit Site List"** button and add http://josericardojunior.com/Dominoes/ site.

4. After adding this site to the list of exception, Dominoes can be loaded directly through [here](http://josericardojunior.com/Dominoes/Dominoes.jnlp).

**Observation**: *Please notice that right now the library is just available for MacOSX and Linux.*
